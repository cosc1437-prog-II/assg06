**Description**

Declare and implement the `factorial()` function to calculate the
product of the first `n` integers.  This functions takes an integer
parameter `n` as input, and it returns an integer result.

You need to do the following steps:

1. You will need a for or while loop and a local variable to keep track of the
   running product.  This will be similar to code you have done
   previously (for example to calculate a running sum).
2. Make sure that you handle the $0^{th}$ and $1^{st}$ factorials
   cases correctly, these are tested in this tasks tests.
2. The computed factorial product of the first n integers should be
   returned as the result from your function.

**Suggested Solution**

**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to correctly calculate the 0! and 1! cases from this
  function.  These are tested, so you can't pass the task 1 tests without
  doing this correctly.
